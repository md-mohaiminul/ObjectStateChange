# Object State Change Classification

This report describes our submission called ``TarHeels" for the [Ego4D: Object State Change Classification Challenge](https://ego4d-data.org/docs/challenge/) [1st Ego4D Workshop, CVPR 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/cvpr2022w-ego4d-epic/). We use a transformer-based video recognition model and leverage the [Divided Space-Time Attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05095) for classifying object state change in egocentric videos. Our submission achieves the second-best performance in the challenge.
